## Thin C++ wrappers for Judy maps (JBitMap, JudyMap)
This is just a sandbox for testing my C++ wrappers for Judy sparse arrays, the code library
(libJudy, http://judy.sourceforge.net/) by Doug Baskins. I am currently only interested in Judy1 (a sparse bit vector (map) ) and JudyL (a more generic long to long/pointer map).
